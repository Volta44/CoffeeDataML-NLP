While not a rich banana flavor, it is recognizable, and none of the flavors seems off-tone-much more than can be said for similar products.  After looking at the ingredients below, I was very surprised that the banana power bar contains no cinnamon, and that the apple taste may be actually come from the grape and pear concentrates.  The ingredient list also reveals several grains (oat bran, rice bran, milled rice, brown rice flour), and the source of the banana flavor-banana powder.\n\nTexture: After the initial touch bite into the dense, somewhat hard surface, the ingredients gradually present themselves as very chewy with a noticeable grainy texture.  Again, while initiates may need time to get used to this, it is not unpleasant, and the chewy quality gives the impression of substance (although there are only 3 grams of dietary fiber, as seen below).  I left one semi-open for a day or so, and found that the bar was easier to bite into, perhaps due to moisture absorption.\n\nNutritional Information:\n\n(The information below is from the website, [...] and differs slightly from the Amazon.com list.)\n\n230 Calories, 10 Calories from Fat, Total Fat 2.5 mg (Saturated Fat, 0.5 g and Trans Fat, 0 g.), Cholesterol 0 mg; Sodium, 100 mg; Potassium, 190 mg; Total Carbohydrates 45 g (Dietary Fiber 3g, Sugars, 20g; Other Carbohydrates, 22 g); Protein, 9g\n\n*Percent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.\n\nVitamin A 0%*  Vitamin C 100% ,Calcium 30% , Iron 35% , Vitamin E 100% , Thiamin 100% , Riboflavin 100% , Niacin 100% , Vitamin B6 100% , Folate 100% ,Vitamin B12 100% , Biotin 100% , Pantothenic Acid 100% , Phosphorus 35% , Magnesium 35% , Zinc 35% ,Copper 35%,Chromium 20%, Chloride <2%\n\nIngredients:\n\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup With Grape And Pear Juice Concentrate, Oat Bran, Maltodextrin, Milk Protein Isolate, Banana Powder, Almond Butter, Rice Crisps (Milled Rice, Rice Bran), Brown Rice Flour, Glycerin, Natural Flavors, Soy Protein Isolate.

I don't look at them as \"power bars,\" but rather snacks that are agreeable, tasty, convenient, portable, and nutritious.\n\nPowerBar's Fruit Smoothie (\"Berry Blast\" flavor) is almost there, with a few big caveats.\n\nI shared my PowerBar with 4 others, teens and adults.  All found the flavor better than expected.  One noted that it had a \"fruity gum\" flavor.  I had a similar reaction; it wasn't unpleasant.  All gave it a thumbs up for flavor.\n\nThe consistency was soft in 80 degree heat, like soft taffy.  When placed on a plate, it stuck to the plate and you had to literally peel it off.  There was a sticky residue left on your fingers and on the inside of the packaging.  This didn't make it the cleanest snack.\n\nThere were the 24g of sugar in one serving.  I thought this made it too sweet.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the lack of dietary fiber in this \"fruit smoothie\" (less than 1 gram; PowerBar's Harvest Bars have 5g).  The illusion is a package of real fruit.  Well, real fruit is full of soluble and insoluble fibers, essential nutrients.  The fiber tossed out in the manufacturing process here probably ended up as livestock feed, which is ironic when you think about it.\n\nSo for the consumers who have the illusion that they are 'eating\" a real fruit smoothie,  this bar is, obviously, something else.  Just remember, the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie isn't going to replace a banana and a Clementine orange in your diet.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:  Two years later, with a much more strenuous workout regime (participated in Wasatch Back RAGNAR relay last month, 29 hours, 189 miles), the thing I like about this bar is that it is easy on the stomach as a recovery bar.  It's not a candy bar or, if you use it as one, it's an expensive piece.  I use it AFTER a run or strenuous workout (defined as a run of at least 5 miles, 8.5 minute miles or better, or a full hour of core workouts).  I like the tanginess.\n\n Just throw some in your gym bag.  You're good to go!", "summary": "Fruit without the fiber is too close to candy...", "unixReviewTime": 1215734400}

This was a good coffee with pretty good natural sweetness and good body,  you could barely taste the bit of the astringency (like coffee here in the states seem to have).  Tasty enough to drink black (no sugar nor creamer needed). It also doesn't have that \"oily\" residue that other coffee has. Nice overall flavor!", "summary": "Good Coffee", "unixReviewTime": 1512000000}
